# Popcorn Soundcloud Hyperaudio Demo

This is a quick an easy demo of hyperaudio using a soundcloud audio file.
The popcorn library is used to tie the transcript text to the audio timeline.
Both popcorn.js and Soundcloud API have been updated since I typed this up... so please feel free to make it good.
